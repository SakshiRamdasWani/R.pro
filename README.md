Bitcoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning

📝 Project Overview
This project predicts Bitcoin price trends using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to predict whether the closing price of Bitcoin will increase or decrease the next day.

🌟 Features
✅ Data Cleaning – Handles missing values and drops unnecessary columns.
✅ Feature Engineering – Creates new meaningful features like open-close, low-high, and is_quarter_end.
✅ Data Visualization – Generates line plots, distribution plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
✅ Machine Learning Models – Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost for classification.
✅ Performance Evaluation – Evaluates models using ROC-AUC score and Confusion Matrix.

⚙️ How It Works
Load Data: Load historical Bitcoin price data from a CSV file.

Data Cleaning: Remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values.

Feature Engineering: Create new features based on price differences and quarter-end markers.

Train/Test Split: Split data into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets.

Scaling: Scale the input features using StandardScaler.

Model Training: Train Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost models.

Evaluation:

Predict future price trends.

Measure performance using ROC-AUC score and Confusion Matrix.
